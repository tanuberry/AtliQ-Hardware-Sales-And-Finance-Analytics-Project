# AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-And-Finance-Analytics-Project
### **AtliQ’s Hardware Sales and Finance Analytics Project (Advanced MS-Excel And Power Query)**

### **Situation:**

AtliQ Hardware, a leading hardware company, faced challenges in understanding their sales and financial performance. Their datasets were spread across multiple sources, and they lacked clear insights into the year-over-year (YoY) sales performance, market performance versus targets, and product-level profitability. The absence of a centralized reporting system made it difficult for the management to make data-driven decisions.

### **Task:**

My role was to streamline the data management process and provide actionable insights by cleaning, transforming, and modeling the company’s sales and financial data. Specifically, I was tasked with:

- Developing a standardized **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process** using **Power Query** to automate data ingestion from multiple sources.
- Creating comprehensive **customer performance reports** and analyzing the company’s **profit and loss (PnL)**.
- Identifying the best and worst-performing products to provide direction for future product development and marketing strategies.

### **Action:**

I approached the project in the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** I integrated the various data sources into one streamlined dataset using **Power Query**. The dataset included sales transactions, product details, and financial metrics across different periods. I cleaned the data by eliminating duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and handling missing values.
2. **Data Transformation & Modeling:** After cleaning, I transformed the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. I applied **advanced Excel techniques** and **Power Query transformations** to model the data into key performance metrics such as:
    - **Net Sales Growth** and **Gross Margin**.
    - **Customer and Market performance vs target metrics**.
    - **Product performance analysis** (e.g., top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales volume).
3. **Report Generation & Dashboards:** Using **Power Query** and **Advanced Excel functions**, I built automated reports and dashboards that provided real-time visibility into:
    - Year-over-year customer sales performance.
    - Market deviations against sales targets.
    - Profitability and performance of new product launches.
4. **Impact Analysis:** I used the insights derived from these reports to present actionable strategies to the management. This included focusing on top-performing products and identifying areas for improvement in the product lineup based on the bottom performers.

### **Results:**

The project delivered significant business value, with key results including:

- **304.48% increase in customer net sales** performance from 2020 to 2021, showcasing significant growth in the customer base.
- **204.5% growth in net sales** and a **197.6% increase in gross margin**, which highlighted the company’s improved profitability due to optimized sales strategies and product offerings.
- The new product launches in 2021 contributed **$176.2 million** to total sales, confirming the importance of innovative products.
- Identified the **top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales volume**, allowing AtliQ to focus resources on high-performing products and strategize improvements for underperforming ones.
- Aided in realigning market strategies by providing insights into the **8.4% performance gap** between market performance and the 2021 sales targets, ensuring corrective actions could be taken early.
