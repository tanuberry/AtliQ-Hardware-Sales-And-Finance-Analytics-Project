# AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-And-Finance-Analytics-Project
AtliQ’s Hardware Sales and Finance Analytics Project (Advanced MS-Excel And Power Query)

Situation:

AtliQ Hardware, a leading hardware company, faced challenges in understanding their sales and financial performance. Their datasets were spread across multiple sources, and they lacked clear insights into the year-over-year (YoY) sales performance, market performance versus targets, and product-level profitability. The absence of a centralized reporting system made it difficult for the management to make data-driven decisions.

Task:

My role was to streamline the data management process and provide actionable insights by cleaning, transforming, and modeling the company’s sales and financial data. 

Specifically, I was tasked with:

Developing a standardized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Power Query to automate data ingestion from multiple sources.
Creating comprehensive customer performance reports and analyzing the company’s profit and loss (PnL).
Identifying the best and worst-performing products to provide direction for future product development and marketing strategies.

Action:

I approached the project in the following steps:

Data Extraction & Cleaning: I integrated the various data sources into one streamlined dataset using Power Query. The dataset included sales transactions, product details, and financial metrics across different periods. I cleaned the data by eliminating duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and handling missing values.

Data Transformation & Modeling: After cleaning, I transformed the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. I applied advanced Excel techniques and Power Query transformations to model the data into key performance metrics such as:

Net Sales Growth and Gross Margin.
Customer and Market performance vs target metrics.
Product performance analysis (e.g., top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales volume).

Report Generation & Dashboards: Using Power Query and Advanced Excel functions, I built automated reports and dashboards that provided real-time visibility into:

Year-over-year customer sales performance.
Market deviations against sales targets.
Profitability and performance of new product launches.

Impact Analysis: I used the insights derived from these reports to present actionable strategies to the management. This included focusing on top-performing products and identifying areas for improvement in the product lineup based on the bottom performers.

Results:

The project delivered significant business value, with key results including:

304.48% increase in customer net sales performance from 2020 to 2021, showcasing significant growth in the customer base.
204.5% growth in net sales and a 197.6% increase in gross margin, which highlighted the company’s improved profitability due to optimized sales strategies and product offerings.
The new product launches in 2021 contributed $176.2 million to total sales, confirming the importance of innovative products.
Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 products by sales volume, allowing AtliQ to focus resources on high-performing products and strategize improvements for underperforming ones.
Aided in realigning market strategies by providing insights into the -8.4% performance gap between market performance and the 2021 sales targets, ensuring corrective actions could be taken early.
